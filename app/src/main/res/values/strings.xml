    <string name="fdp_description">When toggled, this application will receive data from the accelerometer in your mobile device, and detect a possible fall.
                                    \n\nIn case of detected fall, the application will start making a loud sound, so that anybody close to you can come help ! :-)
                                    \n\nWe want to make sure that nobody gets hurt, so please follow some simple steps in order to improve our detection ability :
                                    \n- our application needs to be able to notify you of detected fall events, so please grant the permissions that will be requested
                                    \n- for the app to be working the toggle above needs to be activated
                                    \n- when you are not using your phone, please turn it off and place it in your pocket
                                    \n- inform anybody who can help you that this feature is active, so they can keep an ear out and come promptly !
                                    \n- make sure that your phone is properly charged at any time
                                    \n\nPlease understand that we tried to detect as much as reasonable possible, so there might be occasions when the application starts making noise even if nothing bad happened,
                                    \nin that case you can simply toggle off and on the switch, to reset the analysis.
                                    \nWe are sorry for any inconvenience, we are just trying to avoid mistakenly leaving you on the ground :-)
                                    \n\n\nThank you for helping us help you :-)
